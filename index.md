## The MLN Team Manifesto

Welcome to the website of the MLN team, a collective force of innovation and intellect built up and led by Andrea Tagarelli, fueled by the passion and expertise of young talented computer-science researchers and Ph.D. students. 
We invite you to join us on a journey at the forefront of cutting-edge AI-based research, where the realms of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graph Mining, and Network Science converge to unravel the complexities of emergent phenomena and pave the way for transformative applications across diverse domains.

In our pursuit of knowledge, we aim to explore avenues with the potential for high societal impact, particularly in domains as crucial as law and healthcare. Our endeavors are driven by a commitment to not only unravel the mysteries within these fields but to leverage our findings for practical applications that resonate in the real world.

Our team thrives on the belief that diversity in research questions leads to richer, more comprehensive answers. 
 We delve into the intricacies of semantic search and generative AI in diverse data domains --- documents, images, sequential and audio data --- decipher the dynamics of Web3, NFT, and decentralized online social networks, navigate the complex landscapes of multilayer heterogeneous networks and knowledge graphs, deal with advanced optimization problems to improve our understanding of challenging scenarios dealing with such aspects as fairness, diversity, polarization, and many more. 
 
As we venture into possibly uncharted territories, our collective goal is not only to expand the boundaries of what is known but also to foster innovation that transcends academia and finds meaningful applications in the world at large. Join us in this exciting expedition where theory meets practice, and together, let's chart new frontiers in the ever-evolving landscape of research.

Here at the MLN Team, technology transfer comes with the primary intention of pursuing a profitable synergy with the research sphere:  involvement in research & development projects continuously represents a testbed for ideas and methods built within scientific research environments and, conversely, the problems and challenges identified in research project activities become a stimulus to explore new directions of research, possibly in an interdisciplinary way.
