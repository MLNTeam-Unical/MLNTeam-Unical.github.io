Here at the MLN Team, technology transfer comes with the primary intention of pursuing a profitable synergy with the research sphere:  involvement in research & development projects continuously represents a testbed for ideas and methods built within scientific research environments and, conversely, the problems and challenges identified in research project activities become a stimulus to explore new directions of research, possibly in an interdisciplinary way. 

Main **Funded Research Projects** (*last 3-year selection*):

- **PRIN 2022** (Progetti di ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale), Macrosettore PE Physical Sciences and Engineering, settore PE6 - Computer Science and Informatics, **AWESOME: Analysis framework for WEb3 SOcial MEdia** (prot. 2022MA- WEZA), funded by Ministry of University and Research (MUR) Italy (DD n. 861, 16/06/2023). 
Duration:  28/09/2023 - 27/09/2025. 
Co-PI: Andrea Tagarelli.

> - The project aims to develop new Network Science and Graph Deep Learning models and methods for the advanced analysis of blockchain-based online social media platforms. Web3 is in fact centered on blockchain technology, which allows the integration of cryptocurrencies and tokens into social media platforms, called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms. BOSMs offer their users the opportunity to be rewarded for actions of social influence and to define and transfer digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thus creating a new form of decentralized finance. In this context, the project addresses some research challenges including understanding how social and economic aspects intertwine and influence each other, how wealth is distributed among users, and what factors influence the NFT market. 

- **PNRR** Spoke 9 **Future Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)**, funded by EU. 
Duration:  2/01/2023 - 31/12/2025. 
WP9.4 (Green-aware XAI) Task Coordinator: Andrea Tagarelli.

> - Spoke 9 conducts fundamental research to define a new generation of artificial intelligence systems and algorithms, with a “green dimension”, addressing artificial intelligence applications that address environmental challenges that have a broad impact on the lives of citizens, with domains such as renewable energy, circular economy, environmental monitoring and risk assessment, tourism and agritech. In particular, the activities coordinated by the undersigned concern “Task 9.4.4 - Interpretable graph neural network models for green-aware knowledge”, and “Task 9.4.5 - Social network and user behavior analysis for understanding the citizens' attitude to the green transition”.

- **POR CALABRIA** FESR FSE 2014/20 (Asse 1, Azione 1.1.5) **DeepStethoscope: deep learning per la predizione di anomalie e patologie respiratorie da suoni di auscultazione** (CUP J29J21001770005), funded by Regione Calabria (DDG n. 4583, 04/05/2021).
Duration:  21/09/2021 - 21/09/2023. 
Project Scientific Coordinator: Andrea Tagarelli.

> - The aim of the project is to strengthen industrial competitiveness in the field of early diagnosis of diseases affecting the respiratory system, through the industrial validation of a scientific result achieved by Tagarelli's research team. To this end, the project is divided into a series of activities to develop and test, until reaching a demonstration in an operational environment (TRL7), a deep learning system capable of allowing the prediction of respiratory anomalies and pathologies, thus reducing errors in the clinical process. The execution of the project has the following general implications: (i) increasing awareness of the importance of early diagnosis as prevention of respiratory system diseases; (ii) improve understanding of the associations between auscultated sounds and respiratory pathologies; (iii) promote the correct anamnesis of respiratory diseases; (iv) encourage interaction between doctor and patient, through the sharing of information on auscultation data and the results of the predictive system.

- **POR CALABRIA** FESR FSE 2014/20 (Asse 1, Azione 1.3.2) **Smart Cities Lab** (CUP J89J21009750007), funded by Regione Calabria (DDG n. 9269, 15/09/2021).
Duration:  1/11/2021 - 30/06/2023. 
Project Scientific Coordinator: Andrea Tagarelli.

> - The project was created to offer an opportunity to improve some aspects of our society, which lives in a particular territory with a rich potential such that of the Cosenza hinterland. To this end, the project partners have defined and developed an Urban Digital Ecosystem, capable of supporting technological and organizational innovation processes for the construction of Integrated Platforms of Smart Cities Products and Services. Through artificial intelligence, IoT and Big Data Analytics solutions, the Urban Digital Ecosystem aims to encourage and encourage communication and interaction between the two main actors in the territory, namely municipalities and citizens, on topics of common interest, which range from the detection of environmental conditions linked to some forms of air pollution to the online debate on sustainability and attractiveness inherent to the main points of aggregation of citizens, from mobility flows in the area to information flows on cultural and political events as well as emergency events.


- **MISE-funded Project** for “Progetti di ricerca e sviluppo in settori applicativi della Strategia Nazionale di Specializzazione Intelligente (SNSI) relativi a Fabbrica Intelligente” **CATCH 4.0 - An intelligent Consumer-centric Approach To manage engagements, Contents & insights**.
Duration: 1/01/2020 - 31/12/2022
DIMES Scientific Coordinator: Andrea Tagarelli.
 
> - The project aims to study methodologies, techniques, architectures and innovative software solutions to support omnichannel marketing strategies through the creation of data acquisition, information analysis and knowledge extraction platforms applied to scenarios of interest to pursue customer engagement and satisfaction objectives. Desiderata generali also concern attention to the management of the heterogeneity of the types of information sources and the design of the optimal flow for the recovery of information, as well as guaranteeing the compliance of data collection in compliance with current regulations in terms of data processing information.

***Startups***: 
You might also be interested in knowing about [JurisAI s.r.l.](https://www.jurisai.it/), an innovative start-up established on December 2021, which builds its mission on the opportunity of improving relations between the *legal domain*, the *financial* and *banking services* domain, and the area of new information technologies, based on the awareness of the impact that digitalization and AI are having on law and finance to an ever-increasing extent.
