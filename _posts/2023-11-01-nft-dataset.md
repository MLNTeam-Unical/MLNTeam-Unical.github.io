🚨 Are you ready for a rollercoaster ride? The NFT-70M dataset is here! 🔥

🤯 Containing more than 70 million NFT records, this is supposed to be the most extensive and up-to-date collection of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) transactions, featuring tons of metadata, textual descriptions, and image contents.

👨🏻‍🎨 At the Machines, Languages & Networks Team within the DIMES Department at the University of Calabria, we have created and crafted this dataset to offer researchers and practitioners in various computational fields a unique resource. The NFT-70M dataset supports a wide range of tasks, including sequential and transactional data processing/analysis, as well as the creation of graph-based models to investigate the complex relationships between traders.

👨🏻‍💻 🎬 Designed, built, curated - and made available for research and informational purposes - by Davide Costa, Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli
