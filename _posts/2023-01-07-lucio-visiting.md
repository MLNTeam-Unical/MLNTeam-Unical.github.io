I am thrilled to share that I have joined the [NEtwoRks, Data, and Society (NERDS)](https://nerds.itu.dk/) team at [IT-Universitetet i København](https://itu.dk/) as a visiting PhD Student! 

I will be working on the [COllective COordination through ONline Social media](https://www.cocoons.online/index.html) (COCOONS) project under the supervision of Luca Maria Aiello. 

It is going to be a fascinating experience! 👨🏻‍💻🚀
