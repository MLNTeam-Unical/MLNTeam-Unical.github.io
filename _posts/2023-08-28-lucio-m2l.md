📚 Glad to share my incredible experience at the Google DeepMind Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School (M2L) in Thessaloniki, Greece ☀️🇬🇷

I've just wrapped up an amazing week where I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the fascinating world of machine learning. 

🤖 From inspiring talks by brilliant minds to hands-on sessions covering everything from Computer Vision to Reinforcement Learning, it's been an unforgettable journey! 👨🏻‍💻

This experience has been all about exchanging knowledge, forging new friendships, and creating unique memories! 🌟

Leaving with a boatload of motivation to push this fantastic field of research forward! 🚀
