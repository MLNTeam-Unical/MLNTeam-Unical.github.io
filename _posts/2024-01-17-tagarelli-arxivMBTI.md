🚀 Can Open LLMs Emulate Human-like Personalities? 🌐✨

🤖 Ever wondered about the fascinating convergence of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and human psychology? 
Our latest research delves into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to emulate human personalities, with a special focus on Open LLMs.

🧠 Our team crafted ten LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models. These agents were then subjected to a battery of assessments involving the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. The goal? To unravel the inherent personalities of Open LLM agents and explore their capacity to mimic human personalities under specific conditions.

🔍 Our research reveals some captivating insights:
1. Each Open LLM agent possesses unique human personalities.
2. Personality-conditioned prompting yields diverse effects, with only a few adeptly mirroring imposed personalities.
3. Combining role and personality conditioning enhances can enhance agents' mimicking abilities. 

🌈 This study might open new avenues for understanding how these models can emulate and interact with human-like traits, providing a profound glimpse into the future possibilities of AI.
