🤖 **Bringing order into the realm of Transformer-based language models for artificial intelligence and law** 🏛, by [Candida](/members/candida-greco.html) and [Andrea T.](/members/andrea-tagarelli.html), our forthcoming publication with the Artificial Intelligence and Law journal, Springer Nature.

🕵‍♀️ This is supposed to be the first systematic study on problems, tasks and benchmarks in the legal AI domain for which approaches and methods have been developed upon Transformer-based language models, including the well-known BERT and GPT model families, to address various legal NLP tasks, such as caselaw and statutory article retrieval, classification, prediction, entailment, question-answering, summarization, generation, and many others.
