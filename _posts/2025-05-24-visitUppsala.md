Just wrapped up an inspiring week visit to Uppsala University, where Lucio and I had the pleasure of meeting prof. Matteo Magnani, his collaborators and PhD students of the [UU-InfoLab](https://uuinfolab.github.io/).

Lucio delivered a 10-hour lecture series on LLMs: From Theory to Applications. I had the opportunity of giving a talk and sharing insights from the MLN-Team research.  It was a fantastic opportunity to engage with Matteo and his passionate collaborators and PhD students. These conversations sparked new ideas and potential collaborations concerning various topics, ranging from LLM-powered psycho-social behavior modeling to multimodal learning for addressing high-impact societal challenges, Â that we all are excited to explore further.
