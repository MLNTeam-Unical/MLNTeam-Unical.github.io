# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

Our research endeavors span a diverse array of topics, primarily focusing on the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Graph Mining** and **Network Science**. Our research activities aim to provide insights into emergent phenomena and develop applications with both theoretical and practical significance in various domains, possibily of high-societal impact, such as *law* and *healthcare*.  

Key areas of investigation can be summarized in the following categories, here presented in no particular order: 

- **Natural Language Processing and AI for Text**: Text Representation Learning, Semantic Search, Affective Computing, Document Clustering, Topic Modeling, Multilingual/multi-view text mining, Machine Psychology, Modeling of AI Personality Traits, Human-agent Interaction and Emergent Behaviors in LLMs, Language models for specialized domains (e.g., law)   
- **Social Media and Network Science**: Modeling and analysis of Decentralized Online Social Networks (e.g., Fediverse), Influence Maximization and Information Diffusion, User Behavior Analysis (both active and lurking users), Content Compliance Checking
- **Advanced Clustering and Learning Problems**: Correlation Clustering, Ensemble Clustering, Fair Clustering, Polarization Detection, Clustering in High-Dimensional and Multi-View Data
- **Graph Mining and Representation Learning**: Entity/Node Classification, Link Prediction and graph-based Recommendation, Community Detection and Evolution, 
Learning on Multilayer, Attributed, and Heterogeneous Networks, Knowledge Graphs and Dynamic Graph Embedding, Graph Simplification
- **Multimodal and Cross-Modal Learning**: Learning Representations from Images and Audio, Cross-modal Semantic Search and Multimodal Prediction, Integration of Language and Vision for AI Understanding
