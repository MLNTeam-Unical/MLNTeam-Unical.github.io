Andrea Tagarelli is an associate professor of computer engineering at the University of Calabria, Italy. He graduated magna cum laude in computer engineering, in 2001, and obtained his Ph.D. in computer and systems engineering, in 2006. His Ph.D. thesis work focused on information and knowledge extraction from semistructured text data. He was research fellow at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, USA, working in the George Karypis’s Data Mining Lab, from March to September 2007. He obtained the Italian national scientific qualification to associate professor, in December 2013, and to full professor, in April 2017, for the computer science and engineering research area, scientific disciplinary sector (SSD) ING-INF/05 “Sistemi di Elaborazione delle Informazioni”.

His research interests include topics in data mining, machine learning, web and network science, information retrieval, artificial intelligence. On these topics, he has coauthored more than 120 peer-reviewed papers, including journal articles, conference papers and book chapters. He also wrote a book on user behavior analysis and mining problems in social networks — A. Tagarelli, R. Interdonato (2018) “Mining Lurkers in Online Social Networks – Principles, Models, and Computational Methods”. Springer Briefs in Computer Science, 93 pages — and edited a book titled “XML Data Mining: Models, Methods, and Applications”, 538 pages, IGI Global publisher, 2012.

He was program co-chair for the 2018 IEEE/ACM Int. Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), and for the 8th Int. Conference on Computational Data & Social Networks (CSoNet), 2019. He was co-organizer of workshops and a mini-symposium on data mining topics in premier conferences in the field (ACM SIGKDD, SIAM DM, PAKDD, ECML-PKDD, ICWSM, ECIR). He serves as a reviewer as well as a member of program committee for leading journals and conferences in the fields of databases and data mining, knowledge and data engineering, network analysis, information systems, knowledge based systems, and artificial intelligence.

He is Action Editor of the Computational Intelligence Journal, Associate Editor of the Social Network Analysis and Mining Journal, Lead Guest Editor of IEEE Trans. on Network Science and Engineering − Special Issue on “Reloading Feature-rich Information Networks” − and Lead Guest Editor of Information Systems, Elsevier − Special Issue on “Managing, Mining and Learning in the Legal Data Domain”.

He has been a SIAM member since 2008, and an ACM member since 2009. He is a cofounder of Ithea, an Italian company in the areas of business strategy and information technology.
