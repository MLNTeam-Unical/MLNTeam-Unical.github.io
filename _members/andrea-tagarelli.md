Andrea Tagarelli is an associate professor of computer engineering at the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy, 
DIMES Dept. Head’s Delegate for Technology Transfer of research results, and 
Scientific Coordinator of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab.

He graduated magna cum laude in computer engineering, in 2001, and obtained his Ph.D. in computer and systems engineering, in 2006.  He was research fellow at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, USA, working in the George Karypis’s Data Mining Lab, from March to September 2007. He obtained the Italian national scientific qualification to associate professor, in December 2013, and to full professor, in April 2017, for the computer science and engineering research area, scientific disciplinary sector: ING-INF/05 “Sistemi di Elaborazione delle Informazioni”. 

His research interests span various AI-related topics, including machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, web and network science, and information retrieval. On these topics, he has coauthored more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific publications. He also wrote a book on user behavior analysis and mining problems in social networks — A. Tagarelli, R. Interdonato (2018) “Mining Lurkers in Online Social Networks – Principles, Models, and Computational Methods”. Springer Briefs in Computer Science, 93 pages — and edited a book titled “XML Data Mining: Models, Methods, and Applications”, 538 pages, IGI Global publisher, 2012.

He is member of technical program committees, and co-chair/organizer of international workshops, in premier ACM/IEEE/AAAI/ACL conferences in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, data mining, network science, knowledge and data engineering.

He is associate editor of the journals Artificial Intelligence Review (Springer Nature),   Social Network Analysis and Mining  (Springer Nature),   Computational Intelligence  (Wiley-Blackwell),   AI and Ethics  (Springer Nature). Additionally, he has been lead guest editor of IEEE Trans. on Network Science and Engineering - “Reloading Feature-rich Information Networks”, Information Systems, Elsevier - “Managing, Mining and Learning in the Legal Data Domain”, and Online Social Networks and Media, Elsevier - “Decentralized Online Social Networks”.
 
He is founder member of three *startups* in the ICT context:  
- [JurisAI s.r.l.](https://www.jurisai.it/), an innovative start-up established on December 2021, which builds its mission on the opportunity of improving relations between the legal domain, the financial and banking services domain, and the area of new information technologies, based on the awareness of the impact that digitalization and AI are having on law and finance to an ever-increasing extent;  
- [Bigtech s.r.l.](https://www.big-tech.it/), established in 2022, which aims to harness AI, big data and Internet of Things for advanced data analysis tasks;
- [Ithea s.r.l.](https://ithea.it/), spin-off of the University of Calabria, since January 2008 (now part of Relatech, based on Milan, Italy), which develops ITC service and software solutions, particularly suited to needs of public administrations and medium-small enterprises.
