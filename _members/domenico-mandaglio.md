Domenico Mandaglio is an assistant professor (non-TT, RTDA) within the Machines, Languages, and Networks Team @Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab at DIMES, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the DIMES Department. He received his PhD (2021) in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Calabria. There he completed his M.Sc. (2017) and B.Sc. (2014) in Computer Science and Engineering.  His current research interests lie primarily in the broad areas of artificial intelligence and (algorithmic) data science, with the main goal of tackling (novel) problems and designing effective yet efficient algorithms that are useful to gain knowledge from data. More specifically, his recent research interests include graph mining and learning, correlation clustering and explainable AI.
